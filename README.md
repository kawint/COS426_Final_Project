# Aim Lab
Kawin Tiyawattanaroj and Mikako Inaba

[Online Demo](https://kawint.github.io/COS426_Final_Project/)

The goal of this project was to create a first person shooter (fps) game to allow players to practice aiming and learn to navigate scenes using commonly used controls. The game tracks precision, accuracy, and time, different measures of performance. The objective of the game is to maximize precision and accuracy while also minimizing time. As in many fps games, players can move through the scene using WASD keys and look using the mouse. The targets generate in random locations to allow players to get comfortable with these controls.

We hope you enjoy the game!
