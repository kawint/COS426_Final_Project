# Aim Lab
Kawin Tiyawattanaroj and Mikako Inaba

[Online Demo](https://kawint.github.io/COS426_Final_Project/)

The goal of this project was to create a first person shooter (fps) game to allow players to practice aiming and learn to navigate scenes using commonly used controls. The game tracks precision, accuracy, and time, different measures of performance. The objective of the game is to maximize precision and accuracy while also minimizing time. As in many fps games, players can move through the scene using WASD keys and look using the mouse. The targets generate in random locations to allow players to get comfortable with these controls.


## Building the Project for the Web
Once you are happy with your project, try building a production bundle using `npm run build`. This will place an optimized and minified executable version of your project in the `./build/` directory. Test out this production build by setting `./build/` as your working directory and starting out a python server.

Once you have a working production build and are ready for the site to go live, you can deploy your project straight to GitHub Pages via `npm run deploy`. Note that this requires that (1) your project is part of a repository, and (2) you have correctly set up your project's `package.json` file.
